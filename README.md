# Storage Catalyst

This Clone was made as a Coding Exercise and styled using custom styling. There is special emphasis on Users with Devise gem, HAML and CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) ability. It was made with the idea that notes created should only be viewable to the creator. With the exception of the landing page, there are no public of social features.
